# AI-Dissertation - Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Depression Detection Using Attention Mechanisms and Facial Expression Analysis
This project presents a Hybrid Deep Learning Framework aimed at detecting signs of depression through facial expression analysis. The system integrates attention mechanisms and leverages pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, combined with transformer-based attention blocks for temporal analysis. The model is trained on the AffectNet dataset, consisting of approximately 29,000 images, and is designed to classify individuals as either "Depression" or "Non-Depression" based on visual cues. Additionally, the framework is intended to extend to real-time video analysis for continuous depression monitoring.
